### General Info
Welcome to the repository for the programming challenge as a Sr. Data Engineer! In this project, we have addressed various sections related to software development and data management. Below, you will find a detailed explanation of the repository's contents and how to navigate through it.

### Section 1: API
In the context of a database migration involving three different tables (departments, jobs, employees), we have developed a local REST API that fulfills the following requirements:

 1. Receives historical data from CSV files.
 2. Uploads these files to the new database.
 3. Allows the insertion of batch transactions, supporting one request to insert 1 up to 1000 rows.

#### Configuration and Execution
 1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
 2. Create a virtual environment using virtualenv or conda.
 3. Install the necessary dependencies by executing pip install -r requirements.txt.
 4. Run the API using the command python api.py.
 5. The API will be available at http://localhost:8000.

#### Endpoints Available
- POST /upload: Receives historical data files in CSV format and uploads them to the new database.
- POST /batch_insert: Allows the insertion of batch transactions with 1 to 1000 rows in a single request.

### Section 2: SQL
In this section, we explore the data that was inserted in the previous section. We have created specific endpoints to fulfill the stakeholders' requests for various metrics.

#### Endpoints Available

- `GET /metrics/department`: Retrieves metrics related to departments.
- `GET /metrics/job`: Retrieves metrics related to jobs.
- `GET /metrics/employee`: Retrieves metrics related to employees.

### Bonus Track
In this section, we have added enhancements to make the solution more robust and scalable.
#### Cloud

- `cloud_deployment.md`: Documentation on how to deploy the API and database in a public cloud environment using services deemed appropriate for the task.

#### Testing

- `tests/`: This directory contains automated tests for the API. We have utilized various testing libraries to ensure the functionality and reliability of the API.

#### Containers

- `Dockerfile`: A configuration file to create a Docker container that encapsulates the API and its dependencies. This containerized application can be deployed seamlessly in different environments.
